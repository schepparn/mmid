# 4. Challenges

- Challenges
  - Global scope (many involved, difficult to regulate)
  - No central actor
  - Ad-hoc connections between unknown partners

## 4.1. Scale

Ordering a new IT system is a source of excitement and dread. Excitement because it is a chance to start over, include current experiences and do it *right*. Dread because experience also says that *right* is a moving target, the system will be "yet another one" in parallel with the existing and once in place it will be quite rigid.  

Growing beyond the initial IT systems increases the chances of discrepancies between them. Their purpose is different, which influence their logic and information design constraints. Quickly original data sources become obfuscated and replicated elsewhere.

## 4.2. Decentralised  



- Inkommande information som visar på identitet
? Problem är att det inte finns ett system som kan säkra identitet globalt inom logistikvärlden


## 4.3. Proprietary

Investments in a new IT system is risky. Each vendor only have part of the competitive market and customers inevitable have to choose sides. This risk is further exaggerated as service providers issue their own standards to cement customer loyalty.

In an inherently global setting (e.g. the logistics industry) the practice of separating entities with data and interface formats is devastating the scope of the potential services. The current situation is similar to when two separate cultures with completely different languages and customs meet. Understanding is arduous and results in uncertain agreements.

- Inkommande information som visar på standarder
? Problem är att det inte finns utveckling och underhåll av en gemensam standard
