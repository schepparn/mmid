# 2. Background

The potential value of sharing information between company functions and organisational boundaries is apparent in most sectors. As companies and teams within companies become increasingly specialised the information and interfaces between them start to drift apart. The effect is similar to what happens when people with the same original language move apart. As time passes; new concepts become adopted, slight variations in pronunciation develop and more effort is needed for interpretation.

Standards and interfaces also transform in similar patterns to language. Left unchecked standards will begin to drift apart as they accommodate for new terminology and interaction patterns. Much effort goes into keeping standards and interfaces aligned. The healthcare and maritime transport sector will set the scene before the particulars of multi-modal logistics is explained.
