## 5.1. Architecture

The fundamental premise of the proposed architecture is to utilise the maturity and scalability of HTML links that power the internet. However, instead of making the links point at documents they point at individual fragments of data. The shift in model removes the constraints of the original document and allows the individual pieces of data to link up to any number of related pieces of data.

BILD! documents with data points that are linked

The links are described by the type of action that is asserted by one data point on another. In grammatical terms the links are labeled as *predicate* and the two data points are the *subject* and *object*. The structure is well defined, open and flexible to accommodate all types of descriptions. The triplet subject-predicate-object is commonly known as the building blocks of a complete sentence.

Furthermore, the technology for storing, querying and manipulating is mature. Several efficient tools are a available for the major programming languages.
